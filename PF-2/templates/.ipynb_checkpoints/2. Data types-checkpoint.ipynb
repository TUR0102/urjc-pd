Data values are pure data, whereas behaviour is implemented through functions that interpret those values. This is done this way in order to improve modularity and allow both concerns to evolve independently. For instance, we may later add an interpreter `toEPS`, and we would not need to modify the inheritance hierarchy (the class `Shape` could even be out of our codebase). "
